# Installation #

Open a shell, got to app root folder and execute command:

``` shell
npm install
```

All modules required will be downloaded and installed.

### Configure API URL

The app uses a fake API REST called "*json-server*", which stores data in a simple json file.
To configure the URL and port on which the API will listen:

1. Copy file "*.env.example*" to "*.env*"

2. In "*.env*" file, configure URL and port, in environment variable "API_URL"
Default value is "http://localhost:8000/".
Example:
``` shell
API_URL=http://localhost:8000/
```

3. Open file *package.json*, and make sure that in the entry "scripts" --> "server", the parameters "--host" and "--port" are the same that indicated in *.env* file.
Example:
``` shell
 "scripts": {
     "server": "cd src/data && json-server --watch db.json --port=8000 --host=localhost --delay=100"
 }
```
Note: the *delay* parameter indicates the miliseconds that the server will delay in delivering data, useful for testing purposes

### Install Database

Copy file "*db.sample.json*" in folder "*src/data*" to "db.json".

# Execution

### Run API Server (json-server)

Open a shell and run the command:

``` shell
npm run server
```

The API server must be running for the application to retrieve data correctly.


### Run Development Server

In a shell, run the command:
``` shell
npm start
```

The development server will listen by default on port 3000.
To change this port, open file "*webpack.dev-config.js*", and change the value in the entry "*port*" oft the devServer configuration object.
Example:
``` javascript
devServer: {
	open: false,
	overlay: true,
	port: 3000
  }
```

### Build Production app

In a shell, run the command:
``` shell
npm run build
```
The produccion app will generated in the folder "***dist***"

# Notes for Instructor

* **Get comments number for every article:**
The number of comments of the articles is obtained by making an extra request to the API for each article, since the json server did not offer ways to include this number when obtaining the articles. It is assumed that the supposed real backend would already return this number in the request of the list of articles.

* **Article image load:**
Since the json-server is also capable of serving images, in some articles (music category), the URL of the image has been configured to be served from this backend.
Four images have been created, one by default, and others for the widths of 600, 900 and 1200 pixels wide, to load the appropriate to each resolution using an srcset, and this logic has been added in the javascript of the component that generates the HTML.
The user 1 photo also loads from this backend.
For the rest of the images coming from other URLs, simply the srcset will fail and the default image will be obtained.

	**Problem**: by default the json-server listen on 'localhost'. If we want to use another IP address for testing on another computer, it would be necessary to make the following changes:
	* Change the IP address on .env file
	* Change the IP address on package.json script entry for "server"
	* Change the URL of the images in *db.json*, for the field 'imageURL' of user 1 and articles 2 and 5.

* **Fonts**
The app uses two google fonts (Muli and Cabin), which are loaded from *assets/fonts* folder using the file-loader webpack plugin.

* **Animations**
The app uses the animations library "scrollreveal" (https://github.com/scrollreveal/scrollreveal)
