### Configure API URL

The app uses a fake API REST called "*json-server*", which stores data in a simple json file.
To configure the URL and port on which the API will listen:

1. Copy file "*.env.example*" to "*.env*"

2. In "*.env*" file, configure URL and port, in environment variable "API_URL"
Default value is "http://localhost:8000/".
Example:
``` shell
API_URL=http://localhost:8000/
```

3. Open file *package.json*, and make sure that in the entry "scripts" --> "server", the parameters "--host" and "--port" are the same that indicated in *.env* file.
Example:
``` shell
 "scripts": {
     "server": "cd src/data && json-server --watch db.json --port=8000 --host=localhost"
 }
